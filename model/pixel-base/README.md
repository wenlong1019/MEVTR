## PIXEL (Pixel-based Encoder of Language)

PIXEL is a language model trained to reconstruct masked image patches that contain rendered text. PIXEL was pretrained on the *English* Wikipedia and Bookcorpus (in total around 3.2B words) but can theoretically be finetuned on data in any written language that can be typeset on a computer screen because it operates on rendered text as opposed to using a tokenizer with a fixed vocabulary.
